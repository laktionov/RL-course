# RL-course

This Reinforcement Learning course covers fundamental topics in sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

The author is primarily inspired by the excellent [Practical_RL](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL) course, which he studied at [YSDA](https://academy.yandex.com/dataschool/). The practical assignments and homeworks are adapted and extended from the materials presented in the Practical RL course.
