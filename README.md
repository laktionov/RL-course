# RL-course

This Reinforcement Learning course covers basic topics in sequential decision making under uncertainty.

The author is mainly inspired by the marvellous [Practical_RL](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL) course which he has studied at [YSDA](https://academy.yandex.com/dataschool/). 
Practical assignments and hometasks are the adapted versions of the materials presented in Practical_RL course. However
[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org) is used instead of [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev) where it is possible. For instance, Gymnasium does not fully support Atari games so far (December, 2022).
